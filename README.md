# Amusement-Park
This was the second project from my computer graphics class at PSU (CS 447). 
This project consisted of creating a 3D amusement park using OpenGL. This program was created with FLTK. 
In order to run and compile this program you will need to have FLTK set up.

Acknowledgment:
This project was designed by Dr. Stephen Chenney for his Computer Graphics course that he taught at UW-Madison.
This code uses some setup code from my instructor for CS 447 Feng Liu (https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~fliu/).
