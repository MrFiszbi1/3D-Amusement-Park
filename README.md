# Amusement-Park
This was the second project from my computer graphics class at PSU (CS 447). 
This project consisted of creating a 3D amusement park using OpenGL. This program was created with FLTK. 
In order to run and compile this program you will need to have FLTK set up.

This project was designed by Dr. Stephen Chenney for his Computer Graphics course that he taught at UW-Madison.
This code uses some setup code from my instructor for CS 447 Feng Liu (https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~fliu/).
